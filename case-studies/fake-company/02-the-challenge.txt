Fake Company came to 711Media seeking help in managing their paid campaigns in Google AdWords, Facebook and AdRoll.

Working together, we set conversion goals for each month, through each platform and by the end of our 3rd month working together, we exceeded our planned conversion goal by 13% while remaining on budget.

We met these goals through campaign build out with SKAGs, introducing new remarketing audiences, and testing landing page variants and winning across the board.
